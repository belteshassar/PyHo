"""Markov Chain for generating lists of any immutable objects. Typical use case is text,
but it is not limited to this. The supplied main() example reads a text file containing
an excerpt from The Canterbury Tales (chaucer.txt) and generates a Markov Chain based on
it. The Markov Chain is of order 6 and the basic unit is a character. It is possible to
use the supplied class for creating Markov chains with words as the basic unit as well.
Any choice of order is supported so feel free to play around.

The order defines how many previous characters should be looked at when deciding which
one should follow. Higher order gives more coherent text, but make the order too high
and you will just copy large swaths of the original. You can try with other sources as
well and see what works well. It is really the quality of the source material that
defines the quality of the output. Generally, the source should be as large as possible,
but since my code keeps the generated model in memory it canâ€™t handle too large datasets.
This could be improved by storing the model in a database."""
